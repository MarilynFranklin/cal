NSS-Linked-List
===============

This is the exercise for week 2 day 1.

Instructons
-----------

  1. Read about unit testing at the following links:
    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development
    * http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/unittests.html
  2. Clone this repository (`git clone git@github.com:elizabrock/NSS-Linked-List.git`)
  3. cd into the NSS-Linked-List folder on your computer
  4. Run `rake` to run the test suite
  5. Make the test suite pass by implementing the LinkedList and LinkedListItem classes
    * Choose one test at a time to work on
    * Once the tests pass, you should refactor and clean up your code


More Information
----------------

The tests for the project are in the /tests directory.

The stubbed classes that you are to implement are in the /lib directory.

I have numbered the unit tests to give you a hint at the easiest implementation order.
